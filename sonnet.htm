<h2>SONNET 1</h2>
<p>
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,<br />
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br />
But as the riper should by time decease,<br />
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br />
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br />
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament<br />
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br />
Within thine own bud buriest thy content<br />
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.<br />
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br />
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<br />
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>SONNET 2</h2>
<p>
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,<br />
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now <br />
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:<br />
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,<br />
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,<br />
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,<br />
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.<br />
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br />
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br />
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'<br />
Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br />
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br />
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<br />
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>SONNET 3</h2>
<p>
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest <br />
Now is the time that face should form another; <br />
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, <br />
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. <br />
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb <br />
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? <br />
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb <br />
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? <br />
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee <br />
Calls back the lovely April of her prime: <br />
So thou through windows of thine age shall see <br />
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. <br />
But if thou live, remember'd not to be, <br />
Die single, and thine image dies with thee. <br />
</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" />
<h2>SONNET 4</h2>
<p>
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend <br />
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? <br />
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, <br />
And being frank she lends to those are free. <br />
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse <br />
The bounteous largess given thee to give? <br />
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use <br />
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? <br />
For having traffic with thyself alone, <br />
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive. <br />
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone, <br />
What acceptable audit canst thou leave? <br />
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee, <br />
Which, used, lives th' executor to be. <br />
