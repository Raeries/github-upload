Please create an XHTML document from the text file included.  Name this document "sonnet.htm".
Use Notepad to get used to hand-coding everything. The extension of an XHTML doc is the same as an HTML doc (.htm or .html).

Start your document with this doctype.
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
	   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Complete a valid HTML template document using the required tags of <head>, <body>, <html>, <title>. This is a review from Intro to HTML.

Separate each line with an XHTML break tag.

Each sonnet should be within it's own paragraph.


Replace the lines (-----) with an XHTML <hr> tag (horizontal rule)
	Try the "noshade" attribute, making sure it is not minimized.

Add heading tags where appropriate.

Insert the images (anywhere you like).

Do some basic text styling with internal CSS (font, size, etc. Add colours to your headings).

Design is not a factor, but if you have some time on your hands, make it as pretty as you like. You do NOT have to use any layout techniques in tables or CSS.
